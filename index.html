   <h1>Peter Moschitto's Skiing Web Page</h1>
   <p>
     Welcome to my web page.  This
     web page is a demonstration of
     HTML images and my interest in skiing. The first image I chose is a skiing image from <a href="https://www.vexels.com/vectors/preview/100137/ski-in-the-snowy-mountain-vector-scene/"> Vexels.com</a>. This is a raster image of a skiing landscape. I used this image because it has a PNG file type which allows for a more efficient webpage because I don't need to worry about quality of image and high resolution.

   Here is an additional skiing photo from <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/vintage-poster-winter-background-mountain-landscape-2188933555/"> Shutterstock</a>. This image is also a raster image and it is also more efficient because it has a jPEG file type and I do not need to preserve high image resoluvtion.
