   <h1>Peter Moschitto's Skiing Web Page</h1>
   <p>
     Welcome to my web page.  This
     web page is a demonstration of
     HTML images and my interest in skiing. The first image I chose is a skiing image from <a href="https://www.vexels.com/vectors/preview/100137/ski-in-the-snowy-mountain-vector-scene/"> Vexels.com</a>. This is a vector image which allows it to be scaled without losing quality and tends to have a smaller file size.
